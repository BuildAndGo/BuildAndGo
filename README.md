# BuildAndGo

Build and Go is an augmented reality mobile game for Android and iOS X. Search the world for car parts until you find everything you need to build your racer. Once your car is complete, race to become the new Build and Go champion.


# Technologies
Build and Go was made using React Native as well as ViroMedia SDK for augmented reality, React Navigation for app navigation, and Redux to store state.

Our backend server was made using Node.js, Express, and Sequelize with PostgreSQL and was deployed to Heroku for remote access.
